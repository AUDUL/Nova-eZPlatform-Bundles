Novactive HTML integration bundle
==========================

Novactive HTML integration bundle is an eZ Platform bundle providing a way to do the HTML integration directly using twig templates

It use the [siteaccess](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/siteaccess/) and the [design engine](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/design_engine/) provided by eZ Platform.

## Features

When you access a siteaccess in the siteaccess group `html_integration`, it will take the url and show the twig template having the corresponding path.

You can configure as many siteaccess as you want, and using the design engine you can configure a different theme for each siteaccess.

As we are using the siteaccess feature, u can also use the [permissions](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/permissions/) to control the access.

### Example

Considering a theme `integration_test`, a siteaccess `integration-test` is automatically generated. The siteaccess is then matched by URI, the url `http://localhost/integration-test/news/details` will show the template in `Resources\views\themes\integration_test\news\details.html.twig`
